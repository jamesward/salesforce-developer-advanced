title: Module 4&#58; Using the Salesforce1 Platform APIs
---
In this module, you create an application that runs outside your Salesforce instance: it uses OAuth to authenticate with Salesforce, and the REST APIs to access Salesforce data.

## Step 1: Create a Connected App

1. In Setup, click **Build** > **Create** > **Apps**

1. In the **Connected Apps** section, click **New**, and define the Connected App as follows:
  - Connected App Name: **MyConference**
  - API Name: **MyConference**
  - Contact Email: **enter your email address**
  - Enabled OAuth Settings: **Checked**
  - Callback URL: **http://localhost:3000/oauthcallback.html**
  - Selected OAuth Scopes: **Full Access (full)**

1. Click **Save**.


## Step 2: Install the Supporting Files

1. Download and unzip [this file](https://github.com/ccoenraets/salesforce-developer-advanced/archive/master.zip), or clone [this repository](https://github.com/ccoenraets/salesforce-developer-advanced)

1. Using your favorite code editor, examine the code in **client/index.html**:
    - It doesn't have any HTML markup inside the body tag. The HTML is built dynamically in JavaScript in the app.js file.
    - It uses ratchet.css. [Ratchet](http://goratchet.com/) is a simple CSS toolkit that provides styles for mobile applications.
    - It uses [ForceJS](https://github.com/ccoenraets/forcejs) to integrate with Salesforce.

1. Using your favorite code editor, examine the code in **client/js/app.js**:
    - It includes the basic logic to manage a single page application and generate HTML pages on the fly.
    - The **getSessionList()** function is responsible for retrieving the list of sessions from your Salesforce instance. You will implement this function in this module. 
    - The **getSessionDetails()** function is responsible for retrieving the details of a specific session from your Salesforce instance. You will implement this function in this module. 
    - The **showSessionList()** function is responsible for generating the HTML for the session list page
    - The **showSessionDetails()** function is responsible for generating the HTML for the session details page
    - The **router** object is responsible for detecting hashtag changes in the URL and loading the corresponding page 

1. Using your favorite code editor, examine the code in **client/oauthcallback.html**:

    At the end of the OAuth workflow, the Salesforce authentication process loads the redirect URI you specified in your Connected App (in this case: http://localhost:3000/oauthcallback.html) and passes the access token and other OAuth values (server instance, refresh token, etc.) in the query string. oauthcallback.html simply passes that information to the ForceJS library which uses it to make REST API calls to your Salesforce instance.

1. Using your favorite code editor, examine the code in **server.js**. server.js implements a small HTTP server that provides two features:
    - Web server for static content. The document root for the web server is the client directory.
    - Proxy for Salesforce REST requests. Because of the browserâ€™s cross-origin restrictions, your JavaScript application hosted on your own server (or localhost) will not be able to make API calls directly to the *.salesforce.com domain. The solution is to proxy your API calls through your own server.


## Step 3: Start the Node.js server

1. Run the gulp build
    - Windows: In your project directory run `gulp.exe` command either by double-clicking on it or from a command prompt
    - Linux, Mac, Cygwin: From a terminal / command line, in your project directory run: `./gulp`

## Step 4: Implement Salesforce Authentication using OAuth

1. Using your favorite code editor, open **index.html** in **salesforce-developer-advanced/client**

1. In the last script block (right after the **Initialize forcejs here** comment), initialize the ForceJS library and initiate the login process: 

    ```
    force.init({
        appId: 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY',
        proxyURL: 'http://localhost:3000'
    });

    force.login(router.start, function (error) {
        alert('Login failed: ' + error);
    });
    ```

1. In **Setup** (back in Salesforce), click **Build** > **Create** > **Apps**. In the **Connected Apps** section, click **MyConference**, and copy the **Consumer Key** to your clipboard.

    ![](images/consumer-key.jpg)

1. In index.html, replace YOUR&#95;CONSUMER_KEY with the consumer key you copied to your clipboard

1. Test the application
  - Open a browser and access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  - Login with your Developer Edition credentials. After you successfully authenticate with Salesforce, you will see a blank screen. In the next step you make REST API calls to display the list of sessions.

  > It may take a few minutes for a Connected App to be available after you create it. If you get this message: **error=invalid_client_id&error_description=client%20identifier%20invalid**, wait a few minutes and try again.


## Step 5: Using the REST APIs

1. In client/js/app.js, implement the **getSessionList()** function as follows:

    ```
    function getSessionList(success, error) {
        var soql = "SELECT Session__r.Id, Session__r.Name FROM Session_Speaker__c";
        force.query(soql, success, error);
    }
    ```

1. Implement the **getSessionDetails()** function as follows:

    ```
    function getSessionDetails(sessionId, success, error) {
        var soql = "SELECT Session__r.Name, " +
            "Session__r.Session_Date__c, " +
            "Speaker__r.First_Name__c, " +
            "Speaker__r.Last_Name__c " +
            "FROM Session_Speaker__c " +
            "WHERE Session__r.Id = '" + sessionId + "'";
        force.query(soql, success, error);
    }
    ```

1. Test the application
  - Open a browser and access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  - Login with your Developer Edition credentials
  - You should now see the list of sessions
  - Click a session to see the details

> This is just the starting point for building a custom application written in JavaScript, authenticating with Salesforce using OAuth, and accessing Salesforce data using the REST APIs. If you are planning on building a real-life application based on this architecture, consider using a JavaScript framework such as [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) or [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) with [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/).
